# deeplearning-chatbot-app

This project is inspired by this repo: **https://github.com/python-engineer/pytorch-chatbot**

I used it as a learning project and then built on it a more complex structure, containarizing both the environment and the 
final application and applying software design engineering principles, such as DRY, code modularity and reusability.
